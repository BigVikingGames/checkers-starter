checkers-starter
================

Starter code for Unity Checkers.

Just open the project in Unity (5.3.1f1 or higher), and when you run it you should see an 8x8 board with the black and red tokens populated.

1) Move a token by clicking on a location with one, and then clicking on a valid move location

2) Create an animation controller to make the start text animate in when everything starts

3) The game controller has a game start delay, make it work
