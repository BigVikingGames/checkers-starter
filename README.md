checkers-starter
================

Starter code for Unity Checkers.

Just open the project in Unity (5.3.1f1 or higher), and when you run it you should see an 8x8 board with the black and red tokens populated.

1) There's disabled start text in the scene. There's an empty animation controller and two animation clips. Chain the clips, make the first one 2x speed, and make sure it happens on load.

2) The game controller has a game start delay, make it work, including the start text.

3) Move a token by clicking on a location with one, and then clicking on a valid move location. Where valid move location is a location that is diagonal without a token on it. Ignore checkers movement rules for now.
